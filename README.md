📈 Sales Forecast Prediction using Python

> Last Updated: 08 Apr, 2025
> A time series project using XGBoost for forecasting daily sales based on historical data.
---📌 Project Overview
Sales forecasting is a critical part of business planning that helps organizations make informed decisions about inventory, marketing, and resource management. This project demonstrates how to build a **sales prediction model** using **Python** and **XGBoost** based on historical sales data.
 
In this project, I trained a machine learning model that can predict daily sales with a fairly good level of accuracy.

⚙️ Tools & Libraries Used

* Pandas – Data manipulation
* NumPy – Numerical operations
* Matplotlib / Seaborn – Data visualization
* Scikit-learn – Data preprocessing & metrics
* XGBoost – Forecasting model
---
 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains order-wise sales data, including features like:
* Order ID
* Order Date
* Customer ID
* Product Category
* Sales Amount

📌 Note: You can use your own sales dataset or download one from any public source (e.g., Kaggle or your business data).

 🛠️ Workflow Summary

1. Load and Visualize Sales Data

The dataset is loaded using `pandas`, and a time series is generated by grouping sales by order date.

2. Sales Trend Over Time
We visualized the historical sales data to identify seasonal trends and fluctuations.

 3. Feature Engineering – Lag Variables

To capture temporal patterns, I created lagged features (e.g., sales on previous 1–5 days). This enables the model to learn dependencies in time.

4. Data Preparation
The lagged dataset was split into **training (80%) and test (20%)** sets. The time series order was preserved (`shuffle=False`) to maintain prediction integrity.

5. Model Training using XGBoost
I used `XGBRegressor` from the `xgboost` library — a highly effective algorithm for regression-based tasks like forecasting.

Model was configured with:

* 100 estimators
* Learning rate: 0.1
* Max depth: 5

---
6. Model Evaluation – RMSE

After training, the model's performance was evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):

📌 RMSE: `734.63`

This value indicates the average prediction error — which is acceptable given the scale of the dataset.

7. Final Forecast Plot

The actual vs. predicted sales are plotted together to visually assess the forecast accuracy.

As shown, the predicted values closely follow the actual trend, indicating the model captured the temporal patterns well.

💡 Conclusion

This project shows how machine learning — especially XGBoost — can effectively be applied to sales forecasting. By creating lag-based features and using past trends, the model can generate reliable predictions. This can help businesses with:

* Inventory planning
* Sales strategy
* Demand estimation
* Operational efficiency

🙋‍♂️ Want to Try?
Just replace the dataset with your own, or download a similar one, and run the script. You can tweak model parameters or extend the logic with seasonality and trend decomposition techniques.
